# Training project - Questify

This is the frontend part of the project. The web application has a mobile, tablet and desktop version. In the application, you can register, re-login, create tasks for yourself with a specific date, select a group for this task, choose a difficulty level, mark the task as a priority or not. Also, the system can send so-called challenges (calls), which the user can accept or reject.
